## Install Required Packages
To run this project, you will need Python and the following Python libraries installed:

1. Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Plotly
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
## Data Analysis and Manipulation
The project follows these steps:

1. Data Loading: Importing data from CSV files.
2. Data Cleaning: Managing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and correcting errors to improve data quality.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the dataset to identify key patterns and insights.
4. Visualization: Using bar charts,line chart, box plot and heatmap to understand user behavior.
## Data Visualization
1. The majority of rides occur during the evening and night, indicating higher demand after work hours.
2. Different ride categories (e.g., Personal vs. Business) show varied usage patterns
3. The analysis highlights time-based demand surges, seasonal variations, and purpose-driven ride usage, helping businesses optimize ride availability and pricing strategies.
